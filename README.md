# NEO RPG Character Management API

A backend API for managing role-playing game characters, built as part of the Neo Financial coding assignment.

## Overview

This project provides a RESTful API for character management in a role-playing game context. The system stores all data in memory and focuses on clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation.

## Game Concepts

### Jobs (Character Classes)
Jobs are character classes that define a character's battle specialties and initial statistics. When creating a new character, players select from available jobs, which determines the character's starting stats. While stats can grow during gameplay, stat progression is not implemented in this assignment.

Available jobs with their base statistics and modifiers:

| Job | Health Points (HP) | Strength | Dexterity | Intelligence | Attack Modifier | Speed Modifier |
|-----|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Warrior** | 20 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 80% of strength + 20% of dexterity | 60% of dexterity + 20% of intelligence |
| **Thief** | 15 | 4 | 10 | 4 | 25% of strength + 100% of dexterity + 25% of intelligence | 80% of dexterity |
| **Mage** | 12 | 5 | 6 | 10 | 20% of strength + 20% of dexterity + 120% of intelligence | 40% of dexterity + 10% of strength |

### Character Creation
To create a new character, the following information is required:

**Name Requirements:**
- Must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_) characters
- Length must be between 4 and 15 characters inclusive
- Examples: `Hero`, `Dark_Knight`, `Wizard123` (invalid - contains numbers)

**Job Requirements:**
- Must be one of the three available jobs: `Warrior`, `Thief`, or `Mage`
- Each character can only have a single job at a time

### Character Design Considerations
The character system is designed with future extensibility in mind. While not implemented in this MVP, the architecture should support:

**Planned Future Features:**
- **Leveling System**: Characters will be able to level up, causing their core attributes to change:
  - Health
  - Strength  
  - Dexterity
  - Intelligence

- **Job Changing**: Characters will be able to change their job, with calculations involving modifiers to reflect their new job:
  - Attack modifier
  - Speed modifier

## Features

- Character creation and management with job selection
- Job listing and information system
- In-memory data storage
- RESTful API endpoints
- Comprehensive unit tests
- TypeScript implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the server with hot reloading for development.

#### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Code Quality

Check TypeScript types:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

**ðŸ”— [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)**

### API Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/characters` | GET | Get paginated list of characters with name, job, and status |
| `/api/characters` | POST | Create a new character |
| `/api/characters/:id` | GET | Get character details by ID |
| `/api/jobs` | GET | Get all available jobs with stats and formulas |
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check endpoint |

### Character Listing with Pagination

The characters endpoint supports pagination to efficiently handle large numbers of characters:

**Query Parameters:**
- `page` (optional): Page number, defaults to 1
- `limit` (optional): Items per page (1-100), defaults to 10

```bash
# Get first page (default: 10 characters)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/characters

# Get specific page with custom limit
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/characters?page=2&limit=5"

# Get maximum characters per page
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/characters?limit=100"
```

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Character_Name",
      "job": "Warrior",
      "status": "Alive",
      "healthPoints": 20,
      "strength": 10,
      "dexterity": 5,
      "intelligence": 5,
      "attackModifier": 9,
      "speedModifier": 4
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalItems": 42,
    "itemsPerPage": 10,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPreviousPage": false
  }
}
```

### Character Creation Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/characters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hero_Knight",
    "job": "Warrior"
  }'
```
